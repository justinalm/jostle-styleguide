# jostle-styleguide
This guide is for Jostle designers and developers. Our goal with this guide is to maintain consistency across the platform as well as design iterations. A button is a button is a btn.

## Dependencies

## Go to know
The SCSS is highly structured and pretty much all of our base values for style are found in the `_sass/style-guide/_variables.scss` file. The goal is to not add to the CSS but use all of our atomic elements and classes to build new features.
